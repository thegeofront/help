# Q/A 

### What am I looking at? 
Geofront is an application which strives to make geodata processing more accessible to a wider audience. 
This github organization houses multiple repositories aimed to that purpose. 
- the [App](https://github.com/thegeofront/app) repo houses the main application, found at [geofront.nl](geofront.nl).
- the [Engine](https://github.com/thegeofront/engine) repo hosts the 3d engine uses for visualization purposes. 
- the [Std](https://github.com/thegeofront/std) repo houses standard components usable within the geofront app.


### What is the current state of Geofront? 
Right now, geofront is in pre-alpha state. It is in active development, and many features are subject to change.
